In a new HTML file, create three ordered lists. Each list should have four items.

The first should be a list of four cities. The entire list should have an id of "cities".

The second should be a list of four food entrees. Two of them should contain meat, and two of them should be vegetarian. The meat list items should have a class called "meat". The vegetarian list items should have a class called "vegetarian".

The third should be a list of four movies. Your favorite movie on that list should have an id called "favorite". Only that list item should have an id.

In the style section, use CSS selectors to color your target elements.

Color the entire list of cities purple.

Color the meat-containing dishes brown, and the vegetarian dishes green.

Color your favorite movie orange.
